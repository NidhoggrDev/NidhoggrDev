- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @NidhoggrDev, a Software Developer from Germany in his thirties.
- ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in Software Development for Windows, Linux and also IOS. I once was a Web Developer - specialized in CMS and e-Commerce-Systems like WordPress and Shopware.
  Therefore my interest in Web Applications is still existent.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Swift, Python and the changes from PHP7 to PHP8. I would love to learn much more coding languages and more about (cyber) security, but sadly time is limited.
